# Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries that analyze sales data from a sample database. The analysis includes inspecting data, checking unique values, and performing various sales-related queries to derive insights from the dataset.

## Datasets Used

The analysis is performed on a sales data sample using the following key datasets:

1. **Sales Data Sample**: Contains information about sales, including product details, order numbers, customer names, and more.
   
## Summary of the Analysis Process

### Inspecting Data

- The initial step involves inspecting the sales data to understand its structure and content.
- Unique values for several columns, such as `status`, `year_id`, `productline`, `country`, `dealsize`, and `territory`, are checked. These unique values can be useful for plotting and understanding data distribution.

### Analysis Queries

#### Grouping by Product Line

- Sales data is grouped by `productline` to determine the total revenue generated by each product line. The results show which product lines are the most profitable.

#### Grouping by Year

- Sales data is grouped by `year_id` to understand the revenue trends over different years. This analysis helps identify which years had the highest revenue.

#### Grouping by Deal Size

- The dataset is grouped by `dealsize` to analyze the revenue generated from different deal sizes. This query reveals which deal sizes contribute the most to revenue.

#### Best Month for Sales

- The query identifies the best month for sales in a specific year and calculates the revenue earned in that month.
- For example, the analysis is initially performed for the year 2004, and November is found to be the best sales month.

#### Best-Selling Product in a Specific Month

- Building on the previous query, this analysis drills down to identify the product line that was sold the most in the best sales month.
- In the example, it's discovered that the "Classic" product line is the top seller in November 2004.

#### RFM Analysis for Best Customer

- The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is performed to identify the best customer.
- Customer data is grouped by their purchase history, and the RFM values are calculated.
- A temporary table (`#rfm`) is created to store the RFM results and customer segments are defined based on the RFM values.

#### Products Sold Together

- This analysis identifies products that are most frequently sold together.
- It finds order numbers with three items shipped together and lists the product codes that are often sold together.

#### Highest Sales City in a Country

- This query identifies the city with the highest number of sales in a specific country. For example, it can determine which city in the UK has the highest revenue.

#### Best Product in a Country

- Finally, the analysis identifies the best product line in a specific country. For example, it finds the best-selling product line in the United States.
